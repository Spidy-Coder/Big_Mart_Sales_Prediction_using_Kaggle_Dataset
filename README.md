# ðŸ“œBig_Mart_Sales_Prediction_using_Kaggle_Dataset

The current repo contains an .ipnb file which contains the code of this project.

Big Mart Sales Prediction is really a good choice to get hands-on practice on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Model Prediction with various Regression Models.

<b>I would highly incourage you all to make changes in current repository by playing around with EDA and model training part of this notebook.</b>

## <b>Check out <a href = https://www.kaggle.com/devashish0507/big-mart-sales-prediction>this link </a> of Kaggle Dataset for this Project.

## <b>ðŸ“ŒNOTE:- How to make changes in this notebook ?<b/>
 Now, It's your turn to train the same model with rest of the regression algorithms which are as follows:-
1. Lasso Regression
2. Decision Trees Regression
3. XGBoost (for regression)

### ðŸ“‰ðŸ“Š <b>Twick around with EDA part</b> of this Notebook and try to use other seaborn and matplotlib plots to see great Visualization results.

This Project is a helpful and practical approach towards Data science Enthusiasts. So, just start working with this code and show your Data driven skills on this project.
